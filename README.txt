minos is an emulator launcher that temporarily converts a cartridge folder into
formats that emulators other than higan support. It is a companion program to
kaijuu.

On Windows, it is recommended that kaijuu be installed to take full advantage
of minos. Strictly speaking, however, kaijuu is optional.

See minos/README.txt for more information.
